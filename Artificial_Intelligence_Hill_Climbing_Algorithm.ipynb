        "Hill climbing is a local search algorithm used for optimization problems. It begins with an initial solution and iteratively improves it by making incremental changes. At each iteration, the algorithm evaluates the current solution and moves to a neighboring solution if it provides a better outcome. This process continues until no better solutions can be found or a termination criterion is met."
